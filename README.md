# TDD-training PreAssessment - Industrial Logic

## Instructions
We ask that you identify the various design problems (code smells) in the code and clean up (refactor) the code so its easy to understand and maintain.
You are free to change the code any way you like, as long as you don't break existing functionality.
It is a good idea to write some automated unit tests to ensure you do not break any functionality.
